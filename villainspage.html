        <p>Two-Face (Harvey Dent): Harvey Dent was once Gotham City's idealistic district attorney, known for his crusade against crime and corruption.<br> However, after half of his face is scarred by acid during a courtroom trial gone wrong, Dent suffers from severe mental trauma and develops a split personality.<br> He becomes the villain Two-Face, flipping a coin to make decisions and embracing the duality of chance and fate.<br> Two-Face is obsessed with the concept of fairness and often commits crimes based on the outcome of his coin toss, serving as a dark reflection of Batman's own struggle with justice and vengeance.</p>

        <p>Catwoman (Selina Kyle): Catwoman is a complex character who blurs the line between villain and antihero. Selina Kyle is a skilled cat burglar with a complicated relationship with Batman.<br> While she often operates outside the law, she has a strong moral code and frequently shows compassion for the less fortunate. Catwoman is known for her agility, whip proficiency, and affinity for cats. <br>Her backstory varies across different interpretations, but she is typically portrayed as a woman with a troubled past who uses her skills to survive in Gotham's criminal underworld. <br>Despite her criminal activities, Catwoman has a romantic connection with Batman, leading to a complex dynamic between them as adversaries, allies, and sometimes even lovers.</p>
